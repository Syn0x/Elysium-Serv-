Need-To-Know

    If you are the only player online, you will be allowed to explore the map in godmode (you will not take damage). Type !r to respawn yourself, !cleanup to reset traps, and !rtv to change the map.
    This server has an autojump feature. Using autojump will restrict your velocity to a specific value (this varies between servers). To avoid this, disable autojump in the F2 menu.
    Type !info to bring up this window, and type !help to read more about the gamemode and itâ€™s commands.
